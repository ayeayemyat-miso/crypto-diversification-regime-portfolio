# Bitcoin vs Ethereum as Diversification Tools in US Equity Portfolios

This repository contains the code and documentation for my MSc Finance thesis project:
**"Bitcoin vs Ethereum as Diversification Tools in US Equity Portfolios"**.

The project investigates whether small allocations of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH)
can improve the risk-adjusted performance of a US equity portfolio (S&P 500), with a
particular focus on different market regimes (bull vs bear markets).

## Main Components

- `thesis.pdf` – Full MSc thesis document.
- `notebooks/thesis_crypto_portfolio.ipynb` – Main Python notebook implementing
  the data preparation, regime classification, correlation analysis, and portfolio
  performance evaluation.
- `data/` – Information about data sources (no proprietary raw data is included).
- `figures/` – Placeholder for figures generated by the analysis.

## Methods Used

- Daily financial time series analysis (2019–2024)
- Market regime classification using a 20% threshold rule
- Spearman correlation and Fisher Z-tests
- Portfolio construction: fixed-weight portfolios and optimized portfolios
  (Minimum Variance and Tangency)
- Risk metrics: Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, CVaR (95%)
- Bootstrap methods to test statistical significance of performance differences

## Technologies

- Python (pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook (or Google Colab)
- Git & GitHub
