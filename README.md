# Bitcoin vs Ethereum as Diversification Tools in US Equity Portfolios

This repository contains the code and documentation for my MSc Finance thesis project:
**"Bitcoin vs Ethereum as Diversification Tools in US Equity Portfolios"**.

The project investigates whether small allocations of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH)
can improve the risk-adjusted performance of a US equity portfolio (S&P 500), with a
particular focus on different market regimes (bull vs bear markets).

## Main Components

- `thesis.pdf` – Full MSc thesis document.
- `notebooks/thesis_crypto_portfolio.ipynb` – Main Python notebook implementing
  the data preparation, regime classification, correlation analysis, and portfolio
  performance evaluation.
- `data/` – Information about data sources (no proprietary raw data is included).
- `figures/` – Placeholder for figures generated by the analysis.

## Methods Used

- Daily financial time series analysis (2019–2024)
- Market regime classification using a 20% threshold rule
- Spearman correlation and Fisher Z-tests
- Portfolio construction: fixed-weight portfolios and optimized portfolios
  (Minimum Variance and Tangency)
- Risk metrics: Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, CVaR (95%)
- Bootstrap methods to test statistical significance of performanc## Key Findings & Practical Insights

## Key Findings & Practical Insights

- **Regime-dependent diversification:** Bitcoin and Ethereum exhibit significantly lower
  correlations with the S&P 500 during bull market regimes than during bear markets,
  indicating that diversification benefits are regime-specific rather than constant.

- **Improved risk-adjusted performance:** Small allocations (1–5%) to Bitcoin and/or
  Ethereum consistently improve portfolio Sharpe and Sortino ratios during bull markets
  compared to a pure S&P 500 portfolio.

- **Differences in tail risk:** While both cryptocurrencies enhance returns, Bitcoin
  provides more stable tail-risk characteristics (lower CVaR) than Ethereum at comparable
  allocation levels.

- **Dynamic portfolios outperform static ones:** Optimized portfolios (Minimum Variance
  and Tangency) outperform fixed-weight strategies even after accounting for transaction
  costs, with quarterly rebalancing offering a strong balance between performance and
  turnover.

These findings suggest that cryptocurrencies are **not safe havens during market stress**,
but can act as **effective return-enhancing diversifiers in bullish market environments**
when allocated strategically.
